Proposals

Each tutorial should be about 3 hours in length.

A tutorial proposal should be formatted in the following sections.

--    Title
--    Abstract (up to 150 words)
--    Target audience and prerequisites. Proposals must clearly identify the
intended audience for the tutorial (e.g., novice users of statistical
techniques, or expert researchers in text mining). What background will be
required of the audience? Why is this topic important/interesting to the KDD
community? What is the benefit to participants?
--    Outline of the tutorial. Enough material should be included to provide a
sense of both the scope of material to be covered and the depth to which it will
be covered. The more details that can be provided, the better (up to and
including links to the actual slides). Note that the tutors should NOT focus
exclusively on their own research results. A KDD tutorial is not meant to be a
forum for promoting one's research or product.
--    A list of forums and their time and locations if the tutorial or a
similar/highly related tutorial has been presented by the same author(s) before,
and highlight the similarity/difference between those and the one proposed for
KDD'15 (up to 100 words for each entry)
-- Tutors' short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to 200
words per tutor)
--    A list of the most important references that will be covered in the
tutorial
--   (Optional) URLs of the slides/notes of the previous tutorials given by the
authors, and any specific audio/video/computer requirements for the tutorial.

Proposals should be received by Friday, March 20. Please submit by email to:
tutorials@kdd15.org with subject heading: "KDD15 Tutorial Proposal Submission"
